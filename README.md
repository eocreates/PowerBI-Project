📊 Power BI Portfolio
-----

This section showcases my Power BI projects, where I transform raw data into interactive dashboards, insightful reports, and actionable business intelligence.

Each project demonstrates my ability to connect to multiple data sources, perform data transformations using Power Query, apply DAX for dynamic calculations, and design visually engaging dashboards that tell compelling data stories.

I use Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service to build scalable reporting solutions ensuring decision-makers can monitor key metrics, identify trends, and make informed business decisions in real time.

⚙ Key Features of My Power BI Projects:

* 🔗 Data connection and transformation from sources like SQL Server, Excel, and Azure

* 🧠 DAX measures and calculated columns for advanced analytics

* 🧩 Data modelling and relationships for optimized performance

* 🎨 Dashboard design and storytelling for executive reporting

* 🌐 Cloud integration and sharing via Power BI Service

* 📈 KPI-driven insights that enhance business performance

Each dashboard reflects my passion for combining data visualization and strategic storytelling to turn numbers into meaningful narratives.
